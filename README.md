## API
### text1 `string`
This is what you see in the headline of the message. 

### text2 `string`
This is the main content of the toast message. 

### type `string`
Toast message can be displayed either upon `success` or `error`. Default is `success`. If `error` is the case, the green success icon turns into a red error icon.

### position `string`
Can be either `top` or `bottom`. Default is `top`.

### autoHide `bool`
Default is `false`. But you can choose to set it to `true` and use the visibilityTime property to manage the hide time.

### visibilityTime `int`
Number of miliseconds for which the toast is visible on screen. Default is `4000` ms.

### topOffset `int`
Margin to top. If `position` is `top`.
If you display the toast top of screen, you can set the distance with this property. 

### bottomOffset `int`
Margin to bottom. If `position` is `bottom`.
If you display the message bottom of screen, you can set the distance with this property.
